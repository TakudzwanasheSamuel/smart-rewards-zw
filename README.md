# Smart Rewards ZW – The Unified Loyalty Ecosystem
> ### Tagline: One Platform. Every Business. Every Customer.

## Core Vision
Smart Rewards ZW is a multi-tenant, AI-powered, location-based loyalty ecosystem designed to empower all Zimbabwean businesses—from the corner barber to the national supermarket chain. By combining AI, location intelligence, offline-first technology, and Zimbabwe’s own Mukando/maRound traditions, we create a connected network where loyalty is personalized, community-driven, and even financially empowering. We go beyond simple points to boost retention, drive sales in slow periods, and deliver real social and economic impact.

**Rules Based on Customer Actions:**
- Purchases, visits, check-ins, and referrals.
- Digital Engagement: Rewarding social media shares or app interactions.

## 2. Security Requirements
- **Authentication & Access Control:** Robust user authentication for both customers and merchants, with granular access control for the admin dashboard.
- **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data (customer profiles, transaction history, Mukando pot details) must be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (using AES-256).
- **Fraud Prevention:** AI-powered fraud detection for point/service transactions, with secure logging and verification for all redemptions (including USSD and WhatsApp).

## 4. Points Earning Logic
- **Customer Actions:** Points are earned through relevant customer actions, including purchases, store visits, referrals, and digital engagement.
- **Mukando Contributions:** A portion of each purchase is allocated to the Mukando pot, and bonus points are awarded for consistent contributions.
- **Location-Based Triggers:** Customers can earn points for store visits, event check-ins, or passing by a geo-fenced location.
- **Sustainability:** Eco-Points are earned for environmentally friendly actions.
- **Traceability Rewards:** Bonus points are earned for scanning a QR code on products to verify their origin.
- **Verification:** All point-earning actions will include secure verification and logging to prevent fraud and ensure data integrity.
