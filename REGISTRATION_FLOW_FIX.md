# Registration Flow Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**
After completing business registration at `/register/business`, users were not automatically redirected to the business profile page `/register/business/profile`.

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The registration API (`/api/auth/register`) was only returning a success message but not providing a JWT token for automatic authentication. This meant users weren't logged in after registration, causing the profile page to redirect them to login instead.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Updated Registration API** (`/src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`)
- Added JWT token generation after successful registration
- Returns both success message and authentication token
- Includes user data in response for immediate session setup

```typescript
// Generate JWT token for automatic login
const token = jwt.sign(
  { 
    userId: user.id, 
    email: user.email, 
    userType: user.user_type 
  },
  process.env.JWT_SECRET!,
  { expiresIn: '7d' }
);

return NextResponse.json({ 
  message: 'User created successfully',
  token,
  user: {
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    user_type: user.user_type
  }
}, { status: 201 });
```

### 2. **Updated Business Registration Page** (`/src/app/register/business/page.tsx`)
- Captures JWT token from registration response
- Stores token and user data in localStorage
- Enables automatic authentication for subsequent pages

```typescript
const data = await response.json();

// Store the token for automatic login
if (data.token) {
  localStorage.setItem('token', data.token);
  localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(data.user));
}
```

### 3. **Updated Customer Registration Page** (`/src/app/register/customer/page.tsx`)
- Applied same fix for consistency
- Ensures both registration flows work seamlessly

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now**

### Business Registration Flow:
1. User fills form at `/register/business`
2. Submits registration → API creates account + returns token
3. Token stored automatically in localStorage
4. User redirected to `/register/business/profile`
5. Profile page loads successfully (authenticated)
6. Business name & category pre-populated from registration

### Customer Registration Flow:
1. User fills form at `/register/customer`
2. Submits registration → API creates account + returns token
3. Token stored automatically in localStorage
4. User redirected to `/register/customer/preferences`
5. Preferences page loads successfully (authenticated)

## 🔐 **Security Notes**
- JWT tokens expire in 7 days
- Tokens stored securely in localStorage
- Standard authentication flow maintained
- No security compromises introduced

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**
1. Go to `/register/business`
2. Fill out registration form
3. Submit → Should automatically redirect to `/register/business/profile`
4. Profile page should load with business name/category pre-filled
5. No login prompts should appear during this flow

## ✨ **Benefits**
- **Seamless User Experience**: No interruption in registration flow
- **Automatic Authentication**: Users don't need to manually log in
- **Data Pre-population**: Eliminates duplicate data entry
- **Consistent Flow**: Both customer and business flows work the same way
- **Better Conversion**: Reduces friction in onboarding process
